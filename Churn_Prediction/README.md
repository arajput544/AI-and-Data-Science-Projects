# Customer Churn Prediction Project

Project Overview:
The Customer Churn Prediction project aims to create a predictive model that can identify customers likely to leave a company's services or products. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project provides businesses with a tool to anticipate customer churn and take proactive steps to retain valuable customers. The project utilizes a real-world dataset sourced from Kaggle, consisting of two classes representing different churn flags.
Dataset:
The dataset contains a total of 5630 data points distributed between two classes:
•	4862 data points labeled as "Churn"
•	948 data points labeled as "Non-churn"
Key Objectives:
•	Create a predictive model that can accurately identify customers at risk of churning.
•	Develop a tool that helps businesses understand customer behavior and predict churn patterns.
•	Enable proactive measures to retain valuable customers, such as offering incentives or improving customer service.
Project Description:
The Customer Churn Prediction project is built using cutting-edge technologies and powerful machine learning algorithms. It employs the following key components:
1.	Backend Framework: Python is used as the primary programming language for the project.
2.	Machine Learning: Various machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras are utilized to process data, build predictive models, and evaluate performance.
3.	Activation Functions: The project explores the use of Sigmoid and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions to introduce non-linearity into the model and improve its accuracy.
4.	Algorithms: Two key algorithms, XGBoost and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), are employed to predict customer churn.
5.	Model Evaluation: The project provides detailed model accuracy reports, confusion matrices, and comparison of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results:
The XGBoost algorithm achieved a remarkable accuracy of 93%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting customer churn. The ANN model achieved an accuracy of 86%. The dataset was preprocessed, including downsampling to create a balanced dataset, ensuring the model's reliability and practicality.
Project Goals:
The primary goal of the Customer Churn Prediction project is to empower businesses with a powerful tool that can help reduce churn rates and enhance customer retention. This project aims to provide insights into customer behavior, allowing companies to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and optimize their business strategies.
